- Log in using your email.
- Wait for the dashboard to load.
- Click on 'Launch Instances' to start creating a new virtual machine.

**Step 2: Configure the Virtual Machine** [0:30](https://loom.com/share/9a034b9d77f143d18157d71631305b02?t=30)

![image alt](https://github.com/madebydxgxt/Cloud-Techniques/blob/main/Virtual-Machines/001/2.jpg?raw=true)

- Name your server (e.g., 'My Server 01').
- Select the type of virtual machine (choose Windows).
- Choose the instance type that fits within the free tier (e.g., 2 CPU, 8 GB memory).

**Step 3: Create a Key Pair** [1:25](https://loom.com/share/9a034b9d77f143d18157d71631305b02?t=85)

![generated-image-at-00:01:25](https://loom.com/i/bbc22ab6a0284f85aa2d3bffac5421ae?workflows_screenshot=true)

- Select 'Create Key Pair'.
- Name your key pair (e.g., 'MyServerKey01').
- Click 'Create Key Pair' and ensure to download and save the key file securely.

**Step 4: Configure Network Settings** [2:20](https://loom.com/share/9a034b9d77f143d18157d71631305b02?t=140)

- Click 'Yes' to connect to the virtual machine.
- Once connected, you can set up applications like Active Directory.

### Cautionary Notes

- Always save your key pair securely; losing it may prevent access to your virtual machine.
- Log out of your virtual machine when not in use to avoid unnecessary charges on your AWS account.

### Tips for Efficiency

- Familiarize yourself with the AWS interface to speed up the process.
- Keep a record of your key pairs and instance names for easy reference.
