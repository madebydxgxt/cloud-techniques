1
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:08,307
So once we basically get here. Essentially what we want to do is go

2
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,507
to the side of the room, use your email.

3
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:20,368
once we are in here,

4
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:23,668
and this kind of loads up.

5
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:28,188
Essentially I already have instances here, but basically we want to create like a

6
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:32,288
new virtual machine. So basically we want to do is we are going to

7
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:35,968
go over to launch instances.

8
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:39,008
Alright, and so this is pretty much kind of a setup.

9
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:41,368
So you can call the, you know, your server.

10
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:44,928
So I'll just call it, you know, just say a mile away.

11
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:48,688
Server, oh, something like that.

12
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,899
And then we're going to select the type of virtual machine we want.

13
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:54,219
We're going to go with windows here. It

14
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:09,159
wants that low. We're going to set the type of instance because we're on

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,899
like a free tier account. We're just pretty much looking to kind

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,939
of select the type of compute power we want in memory.

17
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,499
So we're just going to pick the highest one in the free tier.

18
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:21,959
So, so we have this,

19
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:25,179
two CPU eight gigabyte memory.

20
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,319
Want to select that.

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,300
So now we're going to select our basic or key pair.

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,580
So this basically authenticates the password that we're going to use.

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,760
So we're going to click create key pair.

24
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,820
Uh, we're going to name our key pair and I'm saying my server

25
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,020
one or whatever.

26
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,240
Two. Okay. Oh, one.

27
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,800
So then we're going to create key pair. Now make sure when this when

28
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:09,141
I keep here downloads that you see. Save it because if you don't save

29
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:11,681
it, you're not going to be able to get back in your system and

30
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:15,401
you can use like a, so AWS does have like another way,

31
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:18,121
to kind of get into your virtual machine in case you lose,

32
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:22,461
you lose that password. But yeah, make sure you keep that key period there.

33
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:25,021
So once we do that, we don't really have to do anything in our

34
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:28,541
network settings. We'll keep that the same, configure the same and all you do

35
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:31,241
is pretty much loss or instance at that point.

36
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:41,781
Okay, so once it says successful, we're going to click here.

37
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:58,593
Okay, so this kind of gives us all the information about our virtual machine

38
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,773
so you can see like as detailed status,

39
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:03,853
monitoring, these different things. So now I'm going to go over back over to

40
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:08,453
instances, instances. And we should see our new virtual machine,

41
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:12,233
initializing. So basically, we need to just kind of wait.

42
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:14,993
so basically when it does a statistic, we'll say, hey,

43
00:03:15,193 --> 00:03:19,973
three out of three checks have passed. So we'll wait for that.

44
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:24,153
But, But in the meantime we can kind of launch,

45
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:27,233
we don't need to, since we don't have to wait,

46
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,413
we'll just kind of launch one of the machines. So essentially once,

47
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:34,773
you know that my web server O.O.1 is running,

48
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:39,513
it'll say running, you know, here. and Daniel has this kind of three checks

49
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:43,353
passed. And Daniel basically is going to want this to start that virtual machines.

50
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:46,113
So the basic what you'll do is, since I already have a virtual machine

51
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:49,333
kind of created, so I'm going to select that to my web server.

52
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:54,093
And then I'm going to go over to instant state and I'm going to

53
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:58,753
click start instance. And I believe AWS gives you like in a free

54
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:01,873
account to give you like a hundred dollar credit. so,

55
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,653
so when you're logging into your virtual machines,

56
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:08,013
make sure to log out so you're not eating up your credit. Okay.

57
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:12,573
So we basically have to wait for this to start.

58
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:16,763
this instance is running.

59
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:19,583
So what we're going to do is go to connect.

60
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,563
We're going to. So, basically,

61
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:27,603
if you ever lose your, you know, your, your key,

62
00:04:27,863 --> 00:04:32,803
your pass key, you can kind of get into your AWS virtual

63
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:35,843
machine using this SSM SESM manager.

64
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:38,803
Um, and I'll probably go over that process another time.

65
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:41,823
But what we're going to do is going to go through. RDP client.

66
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:47,483
We're going to go down to get password. We're going to upload our private

67
00:04:47,484 --> 00:04:50,283
key that we just download it.

68
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:55,463
And then we're going to hit the trip password. And then that will pull

69
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:58,283
up, populate our password here. We're going to copy that.

70
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:03,063
And then we're going to go up to download remote desktop file.

71
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:05,923
We're going to click on that. Here.

72
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:09,983
So we'll cut. Copy. Drop that in there.

73
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:13,243
Click OK. So this will say.

74
00:05:14,423 --> 00:05:17,123
So sometimes like, you know, it may not work.

75
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:19,183
So you may have to stop the instance and rewatch it,

76
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:22,723
but basically we're just going to click Yes. And this is going to load

77
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:26,723
our instance. So bring this over here to see it.

78
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:44,613
Okay. So now we're in our virtual machine. And once you're in,

79
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:46,653
you can do things like set up action, you know,

80
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,813
active directory, various sort of things. But yep,

81
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,173
that's how we do it in AWS.
