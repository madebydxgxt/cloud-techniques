## Objective
Deploy a Windows virtual machine in Azure and perform vulnerability scans using Tenable to assess system exposure and security posture.

---

## Skills Practiced
- Creating and configuring Azure Virtual Machines  
- Managing Azure resource groups and subscriptions  
- Configuring virtual networks and security settings  
- Running unauthorized and authorized vulnerability scans  
- Using Tenable Vulnerability Management  
- Analyzing vulnerability scan findings  
- Securely connecting to Azure virtual machines

## Steps Performed

## Setting Up a Virtual Machine and Running Tenable Vulnerability Scan

 

**1. Access Azure and Create a Virtual Machine** [0:00](https://loom.com/share/97047010c4914b7da2c0bb4d135110e4?t=0)
![image alt](

- Ensure you have access to an Azure account.
- Navigate to the Azure portal and select your subscription (e.g., Cyber Range 1).
- Create a new virtual machine (VM) and name it (e.g., vscan).
- Choose the appropriate region (e.g., East Coast).
- Set availability options (no redundancy needed for this setup).

 

**2. Configure Virtual Machine Settings** [1:16](https://loom.com/share/97047010c4914b7da2c0bb4d135110e4?t=76)


- Select the operating system (Windows 11 Pro 64).
- Choose the virtual network (Cyber Range VNet) and subnet (Cyber Range subnet).
- Set public IP to 'none' for local network scanning.
- Skip network security group setup for now.

 

**3. Provision the Virtual Machine** [2:47](https://loom.com/share/97047010c4914b7da2c0bb4d135110e4?t=167)


- Review settings and create the virtual machine.
- Wait for the provisioning process to complete.

 

**4. Connect to the Virtual Machine** [3:41](https://loom.com/share/97047010c4914b7da2c0bb4d135110e4?t=221)


- Use Bastion to connect to the VM if it has a private IP.
- Connect via RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).

 

**5. Set Up Network Security Group (NSG)** [4:42](https://loom.com/share/97047010c4914b7da2c0bb4d135110e4?t=282)


- Associate the NSG with the virtual machine.
- Check network settings to ensure the NSG is connected.
- Review inbound and outbound traffic rules.

 

**6. Disable Windows Firewall** [6:43](https://loom.com/share/97047010c4914b7da2c0bb4d135110e4?t=403)


- Open Windows Defender Firewall settings.
- Disable the firewall for domain, private, and public profiles to allow all traffic.

 

**7. Log into Tenable and Create a Scan** [8:03](https://loom.com/share/97047010c4914b7da2c0bb4d135110e4?t=483)

- Access Tenable and navigate to Vulnerability Management.
- Click on 'Scans' and then 'Create Scan'.
- Choose 'Basic Network Scan' and name it (e.g., vScan01).
- Select 'Internal Scanner' since there is no public IP.

 

**8. Input Target IP Address** [9:35](https://loom.com/share/97047010c4914b7da2c0bb4d135110e4?t=575)


- Retrieve the private IP address of the virtual machine from Azure.
- Enter the private IP address as the target for the scan.

 

**9. Configure Scan Settings** [10:13](https://loom.com/share/97047010c4914b7da2c0bb4d135110e4?t=613)


- Set discovery options (e.g., ping remote host).
- Choose to run an unauthorized scan (no credentials).

 

**10. Launch the Unauthorized Scan** [11:06](https://loom.com/share/97047010c4914b7da2c0bb4d135110e4?t=666)


- Save and launch the scan to initialize the vulnerability assessment.

 

**11. Run an Authorized Scan** [12:06](https://loom.com/share/97047010c4914b7da2c0bb4d135110e4?t=726)


- Edit the scan to add credentials for an authorized scan.
- Input the username and password for the virtual machine.
- Save and launch the scan again.

 

**12. Review Scan Results** [13:01](https://loom.com/share/97047010c4914b7da2c0bb4d135110e4?t=781)


- Analyze the scan results for vulnerabilities.
- Download reports to help mitigate identified vulnerabilities.

## Outcome
Successfully deployed a Windows virtual machine in Azure and conducted vulnerability scans using Tenable to evaluate and compare system security exposure.
